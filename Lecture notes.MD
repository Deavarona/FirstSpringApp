This file is a space for small notes I'd like to mark after listening lectures.

## Notes for [Lesson 2](https://youtu.be/nLCYk1ySY_U)

- Bean is some kind of Spring Object.
- application.yml is a configuration for Spring Framework.
  Reading this file, Spring creates configured beans by determined template.
- constructor-args
- ClassPathXmlApplicationContext only for files in resources directory
- context.getBean(bean-id, class-bean-you-want-to-get); Don't forget to close context.close();
